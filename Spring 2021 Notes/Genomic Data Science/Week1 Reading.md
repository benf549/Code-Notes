###### Basics of DNA

The human genome is the entire DNA sequence of an individual. DNA stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes with genes inherited from parents for 46 total chromosomes. 22 pairs are autosomal chromosomes and the last pair is the sex chromosomes. Every cell in an organism has the exact same genomic data in its nucleus as its neighbors. The human genome is 3 billion base pairs long. 

DNA has a sugar-phosphate backbone with four nucleotide bases: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine. Pairs of nucleotides form between DNA strands. Adenine with Thymine and Cytosine with Guanine. 

DNA is written from the 5' head to 3' tail. The reverse complement of a segment of DNA has the base pairs swapped and the 5' and 3' ends flipped.

###### DNA Variation

Genomes are 99.8% similar between humans' 3 billion bp genomes. Individual genomes vary at 3-4 million base pair locations.

Variations fall into either Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) or Structural Variants (SVs). Because genomes are so similar between humans, to characterize differences between humans, we only have to look at the sites of SNPs and SVs. 

Variation arises from random mutations from errors in DNA replication. Most mutations are deleterious and kill the cell. Recombination during reproduction in higher organisms mixes genes from parent chromosomes to create genetic variety.

###### DNA Replication

Mitosis is the process of cell division in which DNA is copied for replication. One parent cell yields two daughters. During mitosis, DNA is replicated and X shaped chromosomes are formed, then chromosomes align at the center of the cell and are pulled apart such that each daughter cell recieves one copy of the original chromosome. The two daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cell. The duplication mechanism can be used for sequencing. 

When the DNA is replicated, the strands first unzip resulting in two strands acting as a template for replication. An RNA primer binds a specific site on DNA to which it is complementary. DNA Polymerase catalyzes the complementary pairing of new nucleotides to the template DNA and the primer is extended.

The nucleotides DNA polymerase uses to extend the strand are called dNTPs (deoxynucleotide triphosphates) which float around in solution. There is dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP for each base.
