### Problem 4 - Minimum, Maximum, Mean, and N50

I found the following for read lengths in contained in the `minion_reads.len` file:

| Minimum | Maximum | Mean    | N50  |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---- |
| 104     | 23522   | 2136.23 | 3711 |



### Problem 5 - Sequence Identification

According to BlastP, this sequence is the protein **VP35** belonging to the ***Zaire ebolavirus*** which according to uniprot is often referred to as polymerase cofactor VP35



### Problem 6 - Longest ORF

The longest ORF I found was on the + strand and started at 11729 and stopped at 13981 for a total length of 2253 nucleotides.



### Problem 7 - Most Frequent 21-mer

I found three 21-mers that each appeared 11 times which was the `Max_count` for the jellyfish stats output indicating these each were the maximum occurrence of any 21-mer in the genome:

```
GCATCCGCATCCGCATCAGCA
CATCCGCATCCGCATCAGCAT
ATCCGCATCCGCATCAGCATC
```



### Problem 8 - Human CFTR Gene 

I used the Ensembl database and in the Human Genome Assembly GRCh38.p13, the CFTR gene is found on **Chromosome 7**  and starts at position `117,287,120` and ends at position `117,715,971`



### Problem 9 - Human Genome Facts

Number of Protein Coding Genes in Human Genome: `19951`

Number of Protein Coding Transcripts: `86054`

Number of Full Length Protein Coding Transcripts: `60169`
