The units of energy are Joules (J) or N*m or kg m^2^/s^2^ 

The kinetic energy of a particle is $\frac 1 2 mv^2$ 

PE depends on the scale of the system

Total Energy: $H = KE + PE$

Thermal energy is described with $k_b T$ where $k_b$ is Boltzmann's constant which is $1.38 \times 10^{-23} $ J/K and it is the ideal gas constant divided by Avogadro's number. It is on the order of 2.5 kJ/mol

plot above assumes room temperature, as thermal energy increases, the thermal energy increases. 

Covalent bond, ATP phosphoanhydride bond, and H-bond in decreasing order.

Thermodynamics gives a macroscopic deviations from equilibrium while statistical mechanics describes the microscopic fluctuations with a statistical description of the system. 

First Law of Thermodynamics: Internal energy is conserved. If the size of the system is doubled, the energy inside is doubled thus, energy is extensive. Two systems brought together adds the energies. Temperature on the other hand is intensive because two equal temperature systems brought together will have the same energy - it is not additive so temperature is an intensive property. 

$dE = dQ + dW$ the change in energy is a result of either a change in heat or a change in work.
